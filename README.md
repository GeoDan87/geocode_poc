# Purpose
The purpose of this code is to create a proof of concept tool for using authoritative geocoders for New York State and New Jersey without needing to build a custom Geocoder in ArcMap.

## How it works
This tool enables a user to input an address in either NY or NJ and have the address candidates returned. The tool also uses clipping to return only results that fall within a specified geographic area.
